# Rock Paper Scissors Challenge
## Challenge summary
Create a web app that allows you to play this time-honoured game with nothing but your your mitts :fist: :wave: :v:: rock paper scissors.
## Steps
1. Forked RPS challenge from Maker's Repo. Bundled installed its preset gems. 
2. Replaced README with this one. 
3. Created initial file structure.
4. Create tests for the welcome page, entering a name. 
5. Created app controller and first views erb to with form, and tested post request sent correctly.
6. Tested selecting link to choose tool. Create Player object with an instance variable to store this info (alongside name).
7. Refactored to replace magic numbers and tool options with constants and created a helper method for game object's permutations.
8. Extrapolated tests and production code to also account for the tools, paper and scissors.
9. Created player tests.
10. Created game's tests to test whether it pulls player move correctly.
11. Extended game's tests to allow it to generate a random move containing logic inside in model.

This meets the minimum requirements, but there is still room for improvement. Perhaps, changing controller logic to use game as a top level model.
Some nice visuals to help the user become better immersed in our illusion.
